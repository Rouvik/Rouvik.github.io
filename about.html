          Hi, I'm Rouvik Maji, an 18-year-old student from India.
          I've graduated from high school, and have begun my journey in B.Tech. Computer Science engineering.
          I'm passionate about programming, low-level computing, and chip design.
          I love diving into the intricacies of technology and dedicating myself to understanding and creating the fundamental components of modern computing systems.
          My enthusiasm for computer science and engineering drives me to continually learn and innovate in these fields.

        Yes, my journey began with MS Logo.
        The first structured language I learnt was QBasic.
        My journey then continued through HTML,
        Java, JavaScript and later C/C++ around 2018.

        If you are wondering, why this page has a different backgound, well
        the animated balls was actually pretty distracting, thus had to replaced with
        this animation instead, which is not only cosy for reading, but has its own different charm
        instead of being a blank boring background.
