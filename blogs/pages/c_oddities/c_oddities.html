        <h2>Memory placement, virtual memory and padding</h2>
        <p>
            Memory, one of the hotspots of oddities in C like languages and are prone
            to pitfalls. Requiring detailed knowledge about what is it and what you are doing
            in case you dont want to shoot yourself at foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we begin, here's an example of what we are talking about:
        <pre><code class="language-c">
int arr[5] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
int x = 65;

for(int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) // loop upto 6!
{
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
// Output: 1 3 5 7 9 65
        </code></pre>
        Wait, what?<br>
        Shouldn't this be a Segmentation fault after i = 4? <br>
        Well, may be or may not be, and mostly no. <br>
        This is something I had a hard time wrapping my head around being a newbie.
        Well what happens here is, C puts the array <i>arr</i> and <i>x</i> right after one another in the stack.
        This makes the location <i>arr[5]</i> valid as now <i>x</i> sort of resides in this location right after the
        array
        and is also the same datatype of the array. These sort of errors are hard to track and thus makes it extremely
        important to maintain lengths of arrays as a programmer, it's the programmers responsibility anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, certain good programming practises can be implemented to get around these issues:
        <pre><code class="language-c">
// 1: Use ARR_SIZE macros
// Note: These only work for stack allocated arrays like int arr[5], or int arr[] = {...}
#define ARR_SIZE(array) \
    (sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]))
// Example: for(int i = 0; i &lt; ARR_SIZE(arr); i++)


// 2: Store the lengths when defining in constants or macros
const int arrlen = 5;
int arr[arrlen] = {...};

// OR

#define ARRLEN 5
int arr[ARRLEN] = {...};
#undef ARRLEN // if necessary
        </code></pre>
        </p>
        <h2>Array operators</h2>
        <h3>Reversed indexing</h3>
        <p>
        <pre><code class="language-c">
int arr[5] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
{
    printf("%d ", i[arr]); // :0
}
// Output:
// 1 3 5 7 9
        </code></pre>
        Okay, now it seems even array indexing operators are not safe against typos. <br>
        Even worse - <b>This is a feature not a bug!</b><br>
        What's happening here requires a deep yet simple understanding of how C/C++ array indexing work.
        When you write <b>arr[i]</b> C actually reads it as <b>*(arr + i)</b>, basically C converts your
        indexing to pointer arithmetic and dereference, and it does so with no checking involved.
        So, now <b>i[arr]</b> simply means <b>*(i + arr)</b> and it's the same as <b>*(arr + i)</b>
        addition is associative, so they are infact the same! Even more, you can write stuff like
        <b>0[arr]</b> too with no problem whatsoever! However cool it looks its actually a bad practise
        and should be avoided at all costs.
        </p>
        <p>This is just the beginning...</p>
        <h3>Reversed re-indexing</h3>
        <p>It is also possible to use this same construct to <b>get the value at an index and then use it to index in
                the array again</b><br>
            Or in simple words this: <code class="language-c">i[arr][arr]</code>
            Here is a code example to describe this further in detail:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
int i = 1;
printf("%d\n", i[arr][arr]); // Outputs: 7
// Why? Let's break it down
// i[arr] = arr[i] = 3
// 3[arr] = arr[3] = 7
</code></pre>
        <h3>Reversed indexing in 2D arrays</h3>
        <p>
            This gets even more weird in case of 2D arrays. Here we can too use the reversed indexing <code
                class="language-c">i[arr]</code> to access the inner array and then
            access the rest as <code class="language-c">i[arr][j]</code> where i and j are the indexes of the 2D array.
            The concept is similar here, we again use the same logic as reversed indexing to retrieve the inner row
            array from the 2D array and then index the particular element from the row array.
            Here's an example to demonstrate this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
int i = 1;
int j = 2;
printf("%d\n", i[arr][j]); // Outputs: 6
// Why? Let's break it down
// i[arr] = arr[i] = {4, 5, 6}
// {4, 5, 6}[j] = 6
</code></pre>
        <h3>Nested reversed indexing</h3>
        <p>
            We can even nest these sort of accesses to make it worse. For example consider a 2D array <b>arr</b>
            and then access the inner array using reversed indexing, then access the element of the inner array with an
            enclosing reversed indexing.
            For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
int i = 1;
int j = 2;
printf("%d\n", j[i[arr]]); // Outputs: 6
// Why? Let's break it down
// i[arr] = arr[i] = {4, 5, 6}
// j[{4, 5, 6}] = 6
</code></pre>
        <h3>Array indexing on "literal" strings</h3>
        <p>
            Characters in a string can alreay be indexed using similar indexing operators like <code>str[i]</code>
            But did you know that you can do that on a literal too? Not sure why this works or exists, but it works... <br>
            Example:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-c">char *str = "Hello, World!";
// Makes sense and used to work
printf("%c\n", str[7]); // Outputs: W
// But this works too!
printf("%c\n", "Hello, World!"[7]); // Outputs: W
</code></pre>
        <h2>Memory padding</h2>
        <p>
        <pre><code class="language-c">
struct Complex
{
    int x;
    char y;
    long long z;
};
        </code></pre>
        Here's a question for you - <br>
        What will be the offsets for the members in this structure? <br>
        Well, here we go, <br>
        <b>int</b> is 4 bytes long, <b>char</b> is 1 byte long and <b>long long</b> is 8 bytes long
        and by simple math, we can say <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Offset of x: 0</li>
            <li>Offset of y: 4</li>
            <li>Offset of z: 5</li>
        </ul>
        Right? Well unfortunately no. <br>
        Again - <b>It's a feature, not a bug</b> <br>
        C and friends are build for speed and optimization, and will do whatever necessary to match
        up to this criteria. When calculating offsets you should remember that your CPU is only
        capable of reading in multiples of a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)#:~:text=A%20word%20is%20a%20fixed,processor%20design%20or%20computer%20architecture.">word</a>
        and this limitation makes it a very bad choice to store stuff one after the another in memory just like that.
        Here's an image describing the underlying issue of storing contiguously: <br>
        <figure class="centerFigure">
            <img src="packed_struct_example.png" alt="Packed struct issue image">
            <figcaption>Packed struct issue</figcaption>
        </figure>
        As you can observe, reading from memory index 5 is impossible as our computer is capable to read only 4 bytes at
        a time (it's a 32 bit CPU),
        this causes the compiler to add additional shift operations to juggle the memory and get the value.
        So the compiler instead adds some padding to make the values start in multiples of 4(for our 32 bit system).
        Making the offsets look like:
        <ul>
            <li>Offset of x: 0</li>
            <li>Offset of y: 4</li>
            <li>Offset of z: 8</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="centerFigure">
            <img src="padded_struct.png" alt="Padded struct example">
            <figcaption>Actual structure mapping</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Making reads instantaneous for the CPU. <br>
        We can however force the compiler to use packed memory at the cost of slower reads. <br>
        Here's how to do it in GNU GCC C98 compiler:
        <pre><code class="language-c">
struct Complex
{
    int x;
    char y;
    long long z;
} __attribute__((packed));
        </code></pre>
        The <b>__attribute__((packed))</b> is a compiler hint to pack memory contiguously for structures <br>
        Also reordering the memory from biggest to smallest actually helps from losing the intermediate memory as
        padding.
        Here's how you can do it:
        <pre><code class="language-c">
struct Complex
{
    long long z;    // 8 bytes largest
    int x;          // 4 bytes, next largest
    char y;         // 1 byte smallest
};
// now the offsets are:
// z = 0
// x = 8
// y = 12
// all of them are contiguous
        </code></pre>
