      <object data="./Assets/octave.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="50">GNU Octave (or Opensource Matlab)</object>
      <p>
        Yes, I am even considering linear algebra computing programs like GNU Octave in my toolbox.
        I have recently started on GNU Octave and mainly use for strengthening my mathematical intuition.<br>
        
        Q: Why GNU Octave?<br>
        A: I use GNU Octave cause its free and opensource, and also works like a mere replica of its popular alternative Matlab
        which means, deep knowledge in reflects deep knowledge in mainstream academic linear algebra program Matlab. Which is important
        for my future academic success.
